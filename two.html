      Colvin was a student at the segregated Booker T. Washington High School.
      Colvin was a member of the NAACP Youth Council, and had been learning about the civil 
      rights movement in school. <br> In 1955, she refused to move to the back of the bus and give up her 
      seat to a white person â€” 9 months before Rosa Parks did the very same thing.
      She was only 15 at the time. Colvin, alongside four other women, challenged the law
      in court in the case Browder v. Gayle. That court case successfully overturned bus 
      segregation laws in Montgomery and Alabama. Colvin's story was forgotten, most likely due to
      colourism and her age, as she was only a child.
