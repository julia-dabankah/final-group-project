      Charlotte became politically active while in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, 
      in which she played a part in bringing to South Africa. By 1919 she was active in the anti-pass 
      laws demonstrating which led her to found the Bantu Women's League which later became part 
      of the African National Congress Women's League. <br>
      She continued to be involved in many multiracial groups fighting against the Apartheid 
      System and for women's rights. <br> Maxeke is often honoured as ‘Mother of Black Freedom in South Africa’ 
      because of her activism.
