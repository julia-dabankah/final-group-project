      Born into the ruling family of Ndongo, Queen Nzinga 
      Nzinga fought for the freedom and stature of her kingdoms against the Portuguese, who 
      were concentrating their efforts towards South West Africa, in attempts to control the slave trade. <br>
      Today, she is remembered in Angola for her intelligence, 
      her political and diplomatic wisdom, as well as her excellent military tactics. 
      She is regarded as the Mother of Angola, the fighter of negotiations, 
      and the protector of her people. <br>
      She was a fierce anticolonial warrior, a militant fighter, 
      a woman holding power in a male-dominated society.
