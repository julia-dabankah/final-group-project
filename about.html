  We dedicated this website to the forgotton women of history. <br> 
  The women whose stories who have been eclipsed, marginalised, <br> 
  and overshadowed. The women who deserve an honourable mention for being <br>
  exceptionally briliant. <br>
  <br> <br>
  The criteria we used to select these women were clear: <br>
  we wanted to select women who have exhibited outstandning <br>
  achievements in their field, but forgotten from the history <br>
  books.

    <blockquote>
      “Women are set up to be forgettable. Ignorable. 
      Dispensable - from culture, from history, a from data. 
      And so, women become invisible.”
